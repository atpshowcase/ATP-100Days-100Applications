# Storyworthy Journal - User Guide

## What is Storyworthy?

The Storyworthy method, created by Matthew Dicks, is a simple yet powerful practice: every day, write down one sentence about the most storyworthy moment of your day. Over time, these sentences become a rich tapestry of your life's most meaningful moments.

## Getting Started

### First Time Use

1. Open the application at `http://localhost:3000`
2. You'll see today's date automatically selected
3. Write your first sentence in the text area
4. Click "Save Entry" to store it

### Daily Practice

**Best Practice**: Set aside 5 minutes before bed each day to reflect and write your sentence.

Ask yourself:
- What moment today would I want to tell someone about?
- When did I feel the strongest emotion today?
- What surprised me today?
- What moment of change did I experience?

## Tips for Better Journaling

### What Makes a Good Storyworthy Sentence?

✅ **Good Examples:**
- "I finally told my boss I needed help, and she said she'd been waiting for me to ask."
- "The barista remembered my order without me saying anything."
- "I found my grandmother's recipe card tucked in an old cookbook."

❌ **Less Effective:**
- "Had a good day at work."
- "Went to the gym."
- "Nothing special happened."

### The 5-Second Moment Rule

Look for moments that lasted just 5 seconds but felt significant. These are often the most storyworthy:
- A look exchanged with someone
- A sudden realization
- An unexpected kindness
- A moment of courage

### Building the Habit

1. **Same Time Daily**: Write at the same time each day
2. **Don't Skip**: Even "boring" days have storyworthy moments
3. **Be Specific**: Include sensory details when possible
4. **Be Honest**: Write for yourself, not an audience

## Data & Privacy

- All entries are stored locally in your browser
- No data is sent to any server
- Your journal is completely private
- To backup: Export your browser's localStorage data
- To clear: Clear your browser's localStorage

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Tab` in textarea: Navigate to Save button
- `Enter` (with Shift): New line in textarea
- `Enter` (without Shift): Submits the form

## Troubleshooting

**My entries disappeared!**
- Check if you're in the same browser
- Entries are stored per browser/device
- Clearing browser data will delete entries

**Can't navigate to future dates**
- This is intentional - you can only write about today or past days

**Character limit too short?**
- The 280-character limit is intentional
- Practice distilling your moment to its essence
- Focus on one specific moment, not the whole day

## Building Your Story

After 30 days, review your entries. You'll notice:
- Patterns in what matters to you
- Moments you'd forgotten
- Material for longer stories
- A record of your personal growth

After 365 days, you'll have a year of your life captured in moments - a true story of your year.

**Remember**: The goal isn't to write perfectly. The goal is to notice and remember the moments that make up your life.
